  %h3 What is Enumerable?
  = partial 'enumerable'
  %p
    Enumerable is a
    %i mixin
    designed to work with collection type objects. It's
    methods provide traversal and searching of members.

= step "methods", x: 3000 do
  %h3 Enumerable is Loaded with Methods
  = partial 'enumerable_methods'
  %p We'll cover some of these...

= step "each", x: 4000 do
  %h3 Enumerable Methods Rely on #each
  = partial 'each'
  %p
    #each takes a block with an item as an argument.
    Implementation must be provided by class.

= step "select", x: 5000 do
  %h3 Enumerable#select
  = partial 'select'
  %p #select builds a new array of items that match selection criteria.

= step "find", x: 6000 do
  %h3 Enumerable#find
  = partial 'find'
  %p #find returns the first item that matches the selection criteria

= step "map", x: 7000 do
  %h3 Enumerable#map (or #collect)
  = partial 'map'
  %p #map builds a new array based on the block results.

= step "reduce", x: 8000 do
  %h3 Enumerable#reduce (or #inject)
  = partial 'reduce'
  %p #reduce passes the result of each block as an argument to the next block.



= step "house_1", x: 6000, y: 1000 do
  %h3 Enumerable relies on #each
  = partial 'house_1'

= step "bannerman_1", x: 8000, y: 1000 do
  %h3 Make Bannerman more Interesting
  = partial 'bannerman_1'

= step "house_2", x: 10000 do
  %h3 Extend the Metaphor
  = partial 'house_2'

= step "bannerman_2", x: 12000 do
  %h3 Comparable relies on #<=> (spaceship)
  = partial 'bannerman_2'

= step "enumerable_spaceship", x: 14000 do
  %h3 Enumerable also relies on #<=> (spaceship)
  = partial 'house_3'

= step "alternative_enumeration", x: 16000 do
  %h3 Enumerable doesn't require a collection
  = partial 'fight'
